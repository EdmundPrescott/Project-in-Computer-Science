My Game will be about a Traveling Potion salesman

It will be made in Game Maker because:
It’s easy to use with a purpose built language for making games
It makes sprite/animation easy, I learned how to do it in a day
There are many tutorials to find out how I would accomplish any task I’d have trouble with 

I want at the minimum to have a day/night cycle, potion brewing and selling, competitors and buyers, and a fail state for the game.
The day/night cycle will be used to make the game “Flow” by making certain tasks more optimal at different times making tasks more rewarding or punishing at different times. Example : In the early morning you have no customers so it is the best time to gather ingredients for potions.
It makes the game feel more real
The game’s main mechanic is potion brewing which ties itself closely to the “fail state”. Since you are a potion salesman you need to make a profit or go hungry. If you don’t make enough money the game will end because you will have starved because you didn’t have enough money to buy food. The potions you make to sell will have a ingredient number between 2-5 (this varies between each potion)

Since I’ve stated what I want I’m going to list some other features I want
Gathering chances to make ingredients rarer than others
Potions made for regions farther away naturally being priced higher because there ingredients are harder to get
Harder to make potions will also naturally cost more 
Flavored text, little descriptions for rare or all items so the world feels living
Art work i.e sprites and animation
A soundtrack
A pause button
Resolution options
Save and restart options
A working gui
The world economy to develop on its own, in all the locations of the map I want there to be varying amounts of stores that compete and grow or die off
I also want to have a “Natural Disaster” mechanic that will randomly cause either trade routes to be shut down or businesses to be destroyed making sure that the game never monopolies itself
Three secret endings
Adding detail to towns
